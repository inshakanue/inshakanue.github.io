    DEFAULT LAYOUT TEMPLATE
    =======================
    This is the main layout template for the Jekyll website.
    It defines the basic HTML structure that all pages will inherit.
    
    Structure:
    - head.html: Contains meta tags, CSS links, and page title
    - header.html: Contains the main hero section with particles background
    - footer.html: Contains copyright info, scripts, and analytics
    
    This template is intentionally minimal to focus on the single-page
    portfolio design with animated particles background.

      {% include footer.html %}
